Usage Notes
===========
.. warning::
   As of *fMRIPRep* 1.0.12, the software includes a tracking system
   to report usage statistics and errors. Users can opt-out using
   the ``--notrack`` command line argument.


Execution and the BIDS format
-----------------------------
The *fMRIPRep* workflow takes as principal input the path of the dataset
that is to be processed.
The input dataset is required to be in valid :abbr:`BIDS (Brain Imaging Data
Structure)` format, and it must include at least one T1w structural image and
(unless disabled with a flag) a BOLD series.
We highly recommend that you validate your dataset with the free, online
`BIDS Validator <http://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/>`_.

The exact command to run *fMRIPRep* depends on the Installation_ method.
The common parts of the command follow the `BIDS-Apps
<https://github.com/BIDS-Apps>`_ definition.
Example: ::

    fmriprep data/bids_root/ out/ participant -w work/


Command-Line Arguments
----------------------
.. argparse::
   :ref: fmriprep.cli.parser._build_parser
   :prog: fmriprep
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:


The command-line interface of the docker wrapper
------------------------------------------------

.. argparse::
   :ref: fmriprep_docker.get_parser
   :prog: fmriprep-docker
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:


.. _fs_license:

The FreeSurfer license
----------------------
*fMRIPRep* uses FreeSurfer tools, which require a license to run.

To obtain a FreeSurfer license, simply register for free at
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html.

When using manually-prepared environments or singularity, FreeSurfer will search
for a license key file first using the ``$FS_LICENSE`` environment variable and then
in the default path to the license key file (``$FREESURFER_HOME/license.txt``).
If using the ``--cleanenv`` flag and ``$FS_LICENSE`` is set, use ``--fs-license-file $FS_LICENSE``
to pass the license file location to *fMRIPRep*.

It is possible to run the docker container pointing the image to a local path
where a valid license file is stored.
For example, if the license is stored in the ``$HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt``
file on the host system: ::

    $ docker run -ti --rm \
        -v $HOME/fullds005:/data:ro \
        -v $HOME/dockerout:/out \
        -v $HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \
        nipreps/fmriprep:latest \
        /data /out/out \
        participant \
        --ignore fieldmaps

Using FreeSurfer can also be enabled when using ``fmriprep-docker``: ::

    $ fmriprep-docker --fs-license-file $HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt \
        /path/to/data/dir /path/to/output/dir participant
    RUNNING: docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/data/dir:/data:ro \
        -v /home/user/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \
        -v /path/to_output/dir:/out nipreps/fmriprep:1.0.0 \
        /data /out participant
    ...

If the environment variable ``$FS_LICENSE`` is set in the host system, then
it will automatically used by ``fmriprep-docker``. For instance, the following
would be equivalent to the latest example: ::

    $ export FS_LICENSE=$HOME/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt
    $ fmriprep-docker /path/to/data/dir /path/to/output/dir participant
    RUNNING: docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/data/dir:/data:ro \
        -v /home/user/.licenses/freesurfer/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \
        -v /path/to_output/dir:/out nipreps/fmriprep:1.0.0 \
        /data /out participant
    ...


.. _prev_derivs:

Reusing precomputed derivatives
-------------------------------
Reusing a previous, partial execution of *fMRIPrep*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*fMRIPrep* will pick up where it left off a previous execution, so long as the work directory
points to the same location, and this directory has not been changed/manipulated.

Using a previous run of *FreeSurfer*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*fMRIPrep* will automatically reuse previous runs of *FreeSurfer* if a subject directory
named ``freesurfer/`` is found in the output directory (``<output_dir>/freesurfer``).
Reconstructions for each participant will be checked for completeness, and any missing
components will be recomputed.
You can use the ``--fs-subjects-dir`` flag to specify a different location to save
FreeSurfer outputs.
If precomputed results are found, they will be reused.

The *anatomical fast-track*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with version 20.1.0, *fMRIPrep* has a command-line argument (``--anat-derivatives <PATH>``)
to indicate a path from which the preprocessed information derived from the T1w, T2w (if present) and
FLAIR (if present) images.
This feature was envisioned to help process very large multi-session datasets where the anatomical
images can be averaged (i.e., anatomy is not expected to vary substantially across sessions).
An example where this kind of processing would be useful is
`My Connectome <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000031/>`__, a dataset that contains
107 sessions for a single-subject.
Most of these sessions contain anatomical information which, given the design of the dataset, can be averaged
across sessions as no substantial changes should happen.
In other words, the anatomical information of the dataset can be considered as *cross-sectional*.
Before version 20.1.0, preprocessing this dataset would be hard for two limitations:

  * if the dataset were to be processed in just one enormous job (be it in a commercial Cloud or
    :abbr:`HPC (high-performance computing)` resources), the amount of data to be processed surely
    would exceed the time limitations per job (and/or related issues, such as restarting from where
    it left before); or
  * if the processing were `split in sessions <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1175>`__,
    then *fMRIPrep* would attempt to re-process the anatomical information for every session.

Because processing this emerging type of datasets (*densely sampled neuroimaging*) was impractical with
*fMRIPrep*, the option ``--anat-derivatives`` will shortcut the whole anatomical processing.

.. danger::
    Using the *anatomical fast-track* (the ``--anat-derivatives`` argument) has important side-effects
    that risk the reproducibility and reliability of *fMRIPrep*.
    This flag breaks *fMRIPrep*'s internal tracing of provenance, and it trusts whatever input *fMRIPrep*
    is given (so long it is BIDS-Derivatives compliant and contains all the necessary files).

    When reporting results obtained with ``--anat-derivatives``, please make sure you highlight this
    particular deviation from *fMRIPrep*, and clearly describe the alternative preprocessing of
    anatomical data.

.. attention::
    When the intention is to combine the *anatomical fast-track* with some advanced options that involve
    standard spaces (e.g., ``--use-aroma`` or ``--cifti-output``), please make sure you include the
    ``MNI152NLin6Asym`` space to the ``--output-spaces`` list in the first invocation of *fMRIPrep*
    (or *sMRIPrep*) from which the results are to be reused.
    Otherwise, a warning message indicating that *fMRIPrep*'s expectations were not met will be issued,
    and the pre-computed anatomical derivatives will not be reused.
