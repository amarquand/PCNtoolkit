Outputs of *fMRIPrep*
---------------------
*fMRIPrep* outputs conform to the :abbr:`BIDS (brain imaging data structure)`
Derivatives specification (see `BIDS Derivatives`_, along with the
upcoming `BEP 011`_ and `BEP 012`_).
*fMRIPrep* generates three broad classes of outcomes:

1. **Visual QA (quality assessment) reports**:
   one :abbr:`HTML (hypertext markup language)` per subject,
   that allows the user a thorough visual assessment of the quality
   of processing and ensures the transparency of *fMRIPrep* operation.

2. **Derivatives (preprocessed data)** the input fMRI data ready for
   analysis, i.e., after the various preparation procedures
   have been applied.
   For example, :abbr:`INU (intensity non-uniformity)`-corrected versions
   of the T1-weighted image (per subject), the brain mask,
   or :abbr:`BOLD (blood-oxygen level dependent)`
   images after head-motion correction, slice-timing correction and aligned into
   the same-subject's T1w space or in some standard space.

3. **Confounds**: this is a special family of derivatives that can be utilized
   to inform subsequent denoising steps.

   .. important::
       In order to remain agnostic to any possible subsequent analysis,
       *fMRIPrep* does not perform any denoising (e.g., spatial smoothing) itself.
       There are two exceptions to this principle (described in their corresponding
       sections below):

         - ICA-AROMA's *non-aggressive* denoised outputs, and
         - CompCor regressors, which are calculated after temporal high-pass filtering.

Visual Reports
--------------
*fMRIPrep* outputs summary reports, written to ``<output dir>/fmriprep/sub-<subject_label>.html``.
These reports provide a quick way to make visual inspection of the results easy.
Each report is self contained and thus can be easily shared with collaborators (for example via email).
`View a sample report. <_static/sample_report.html>`_

Derivatives of *fMRIPrep* (preprocessed data)
---------------------------------------------
Preprocessed, or derivative, data are written to
``<output dir>/fmriprep/sub-<subject_label>/``.
The `BIDS Derivatives`_ specification describes the naming and metadata conventions we follow.

Anatomical derivatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anatomical derivatives are placed in each subject's ``anat`` subfolder::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    anat/
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_desc-preproc_T1w.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_dseg.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_label-CSF_probseg.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_label-GM_probseg.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>[_space-<space_label>]_label-WM_probseg.nii.gz

Spatially-standardized derivatives are denoted with a space label,
such as ``MNI152NLin2009cAsym``, while derivatives in
the original ``T1w`` space omit the ``space-`` keyword.

Additionally, the following transforms are saved::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    anat/
      sub-<subject_label>_from-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_to-T1w_mode-image_xfm.h5
      sub-<subject_label>_from-T1w_to-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_mode-image_xfm.h5

If FreeSurfer reconstructions are used, the following surface files are generated::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    anat/
      sub-<subject_label>_hemi-[LR]_smoothwm.surf.gii
      sub-<subject_label>_hemi-[LR]_pial.surf.gii
      sub-<subject_label>_hemi-[LR]_midthickness.surf.gii
      sub-<subject_label>_hemi-[LR]_inflated.surf.gii

And the affine translation (and inverse) between the original T1w sampling and FreeSurfer's
conformed space for surface reconstruction (``fsnative``) is stored in::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    anat/
      sub-<subject_label>_from-fsnative_to-T1w_mode-image_xfm.txt
      sub-<subject_label>_from-T1w_to-fsnative_mode-image_xfm.txt

.. _fsderivs:

FreeSurfer derivatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A FreeSurfer subjects directory is created in ``<output dir>/freesurfer``, or the
directory indicated with the ``--fs-subjects-dir`` flag. ::

    <output_dir>/
        fmriprep/
            ...
        freesurfer/
            fsaverage{,5,6}/
                mri/
                surf/
                ...
            sub-<subject_label>/
                mri/
                surf/
                ...
            ...

Copies of the ``fsaverage`` subjects distributed with the running version of
FreeSurfer are copied into this subjects directory, if any functional data are
sampled to those subject spaces.

Functional derivatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Functional derivatives are stored in the ``func/`` subfolder.
All derivatives contain ``task-<task_label>`` (mandatory) and ``run-<run_index>`` (optional), and
these will be indicated with ``[specifiers]``::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-<space_label>_boldref.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-<space_label>_desc-brain_mask.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-<space_label>_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz

Additionally, the following transforms are saved::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_from-scanner_to-T1w_mode-image_xfm.txt
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_from-T1w_to-scanner_mode-image_xfm.txt

**Regularly gridded outputs (images)**.
Volumetric output spaces labels (``<space_label>`` above, and in the following) include
``T1w`` and ``MNI152NLin2009cAsym`` (default).

**Surfaces, segmentations and parcellations from FreeSurfer**.
If FreeSurfer reconstructions are used, the ``(aparc+)aseg`` segmentations are aligned to the
subject's T1w space and resampled to the BOLD grid, and the BOLD series are resampled to the
mid-thickness surface mesh::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-T1w_desc-aparcaseg_dseg.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-T1w_desc-aseg_dseg.nii.gz
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_space-<space_label>_hemi-[LR]_bold.func.gii

Surface output spaces include ``fsnative`` (full density subject-specific mesh),
``fsaverage`` and the down-sampled meshes ``fsaverage6`` (41k vertices) and
``fsaverage5`` (10k vertices, default).

**Grayordinates files**.
`CIFTI <https://www.nitrc.org/forum/attachment.php?attachid=333&group_id=454&forum_id=1955>`_ is
a container format that holds both volumetric (regularly sampled in a grid) and surface
(sampled on a triangular mesh) samples.
Sub-cortical time series are sampled on a regular grid derived from one MNI template, while
cortical time series are sampled on surfaces projected from the [Glasser2016]_ template.
If CIFTI outputs are requested (with the ``--cifti-outputs`` argument), the BOLD series are also
saved as ``dtseries.nii`` CIFTI2 files::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_bold.dtseries.nii

CIFTI output resolution can be specified as an optional parameter after ``--cifti-output``.
By default, '91k' outputs are produced and match up to the standard `HCP Pipelines`_ CIFTI
output (91282 grayordinates @ 2mm). However, '170k' outputs are also possible, and produce
higher resolution CIFTI output (170494 grayordinates @ 1.6mm).

**Extracted confounding time series**.
For each :abbr:`BOLD (blood-oxygen level dependent)` run processed with *fMRIPrep*, an
accompanying *confounds* file will be generated.
Confounds_ are saved as a :abbr:`TSV (tab-separated value)` file::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_desc-confounds_timeseries.json

These :abbr:`TSV (tab-separated values)` tables look like the example below,
where each row of the file corresponds to one time point found in the
corresponding :abbr:`BOLD (blood-oxygen level dependent)` time series::

  csf white_matter  global_signal std_dvars dvars framewise_displacement  t_comp_cor_00 t_comp_cor_01 t_comp_cor_02 t_comp_cor_03 t_comp_cor_04 t_comp_cor_05 a_comp_cor_00 a_comp_cor_01 a_comp_cor_02 a_comp_cor_03 a_comp_cor_04 a_comp_cor_05 non_steady_state_outlier00  trans_x trans_y trans_z rot_x rot_y rot_z aroma_motion_02 aroma_motion_04

Finally, if ICA-AROMA is used, the MELODIC mixing matrix and the components classified as noise
are saved::

  sub-<subject_label>/
    func/
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_AROMAnoiseICs.csv
      sub-<subject_label>_[specifiers]_desc-MELODIC_mixing.tsv

Confounds
---------
The :abbr:`BOLD (blood-oxygen level dependent)` signal measured with fMRI is a mixture of fluctuations
of both neuronal and non-neuronal origin.
Neuronal signals are measured indirectly as changes in the local concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin.
Non-neuronal fluctuations in fMRI data may appear as a result of head motion, scanner noise,
or physiological fluctuations (related to cardiac or respiratory effects).
For a detailed review of the possible sources of noise in the BOLD signal, refer to [Greve2013]_.

*Confounds* (or nuisance regressors) are variables representing fluctuations with a potential
non-neuronal origin.
Such non-neuronal fluctuations may drive spurious results in fMRI data analysis,
including standard activation :abbr:`GLM (General Linear Model)` and functional connectivity analyses.
It is possible to minimize confounding effects of non-neuronal signals by including
them as nuisance regressors in the GLM design matrix or regressing them out from
the fMRI data - a procedure known as *denoising*.
There is currently no consensus on an optimal denoising strategy in the fMRI community.
Rather, different strategies have been proposed, which achieve different compromises between
how much of the non-neuronal fluctuations are effectively removed, and how much of neuronal fluctuations
are damaged in the process.
The *fMRIPrep* pipeline generates a large array of possible confounds.

The most well established confounding variables in neuroimaging are the six head-motion parameters
(three rotations and three translations) - the common output of the head-motion correction
(also known as *realignment*) of popular fMRI preprocessing software
such as SPM_ or FSL_.
Beyond the standard head-motion parameters, the fMRIPrep pipeline generates a large array
of possible confounds, which enable researchers to choose the most suitable denoising
strategy for their downstream analyses.

Confounding variables calculated in *fMRIPrep* are stored separately for each subject,
session and run in :abbr:`TSV (tab-separated value)` files - one column for each confound variable.
Such tabular files may include over 100 columns of potential confound regressors.

.. danger::
   Do not include all columns of ``~_desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv`` table
   into your design matrix or denoising procedure.
   Filter the table first, to include only the confounds (or components thereof)
   you want to remove from your fMRI signal.
   The choice of confounding variables may depend on the analysis you want to perform,
   and may be not straightforward as no gold standard procedure exists.
   For a detailed description of various denoising strategies and their performance,
   see [Parkes2018]_ and [Ciric2017]_.

Confound regressors description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Basic confounds**. The most commonly used confounding time series:

- Estimated head-motion parameters:
  ``trans_x``, ``trans_y``, ``trans_z``, ``rot_x``, ``rot_y``, ``rot_z`` - the 6 rigid-body motion
  parameters (3 translations and 3 rotation), estimated relative to a reference image;

- Global signals:

  - ``csf`` - the average signal within anatomically-derived eroded :abbr:`CSF (cerebro-spinal fluid)` mask;
  - ``white_matter`` - the average signal within  the anatomically-derived eroded :abbr:`WM (white matter)` masks;
  - ``global_signal`` -  the average signal within the brain mask.

**Parameter expansion of basic confounds**.
The standard six-motion parameters may not account for all the variance related
to head-motion.
[Friston1996]_ and [Satterthwaite2013]_ proposed an expansion of the six fundamental
head-motion parameters.
To make this technique more accessible, *fMRIPrep* automatically calculates motion parameter
expansion [Satterthwaite2013]_, providing time series corresponding to the first
*temporal derivatives* of the six base motion parameters, together with their
*quadratic terms*, resulting in the total 24 head motion parameters
(six base motion parameters + six temporal derivatives of six motion parameters +
12 quadratic terms of six motion parameters and their six temporal derivatives).
Additionally, *fMRIPrep* returns temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for the
three global signals (``csf``, ``white_matter`` and ``global_signal``)
to enable applying the 36-parameter denoising strategy proposed by [Satterthwaite2013]_.

Derivatives and quadratic terms are stored under column names with
suffixes: ``_derivative1`` and powers ``_power2``.
These are calculated for head-motion estimates (``trans_`` and ``rot_``) and global signals
(``white_matter``, ``csf``, and ``global_signal``).

**Outlier detection**.
These confounds can be used to detect potential outlier time points -
frames with sudden and large motion or intensity spikes.

- ``framewise_displacement`` - is a quantification of the estimated bulk-head motion calculated using
  formula proposed by [Power2012]_;
- ``rmsd`` - is a quantification of the estimated relative (frame-to-frame) bulk head motion
  calculated using the :abbr:`RMS (root mean square)` approach of [Jenkinson2002]_;
- ``dvars`` - the derivative of RMS variance over voxels (or :abbr:`DVARS (derivative of
  RMS variance over voxels)`) [Power2012]_;
- ``std_dvars`` - standardized :abbr:`DVARS (derivative of RMS variance over voxels)`;
- ``non_steady_state_outlier_XX`` - columns indicate non-steady state volumes with a single
  ``1`` value and ``0`` elsewhere (*i.e.*, there is one ``non_steady_state_outlier_XX`` column per
  outlier/volume).

Detected outliers can be further removed from time series using methods such as:
volume *censoring* - entirely discarding problematic time points [Power2012]_,
regressing signal from outlier points in denoising procedure, or
including outlier points in the subsequent first-level analysis when building
the design matrix.
Averaged value of confound (for example, mean ``framewise_displacement``)
can also be added as regressors in group level analysis [Yan2013]_.
*Spike regressors* for outlier censoring can also be generated from within *fMRIPrep* using
the command line options ``--fd-spike-threshold`` and ``--dvars-spike-threshold``
(default: FD > 0.5 mm or DVARS > 1.5).
Spike regressors are stored in separate ``motion_outlier_XX`` columns.

**Discrete cosine-basis regressors**.
Physiological and instrumental (scanner) noise sources are generally present in fMRI
data, typically taking the form of low-frequency signal drifts.
To account for these drifts, temporal high-pass filtering is the immediate option.
Alternatively, low-frequency regressors can be included in the statistical model to account
for these confounding signals.
Using the :abbr:`DCT (discrete cosine transform)` basis functions, *fMRIPrep* generates
these low-frequency predictors:

- ``cosine_XX`` - DCT-basis regressors.

One characteristic of the cosine regressors is that they are identical for two different
datasets with the same :abbr:`TR (repetition time)` and the same *effective* number of
time points (*effective* length).
It is relevant to mention *effective* because initial time points identified as *nonsteady
states* are removed before generating the cosine regressors.

.. caution::
    If your analysis includes separate high-pass filtering, do not include
    ``cosine_XX`` regressors in your design matrix.

.. admonition:: See also

    - A detailed explanation about temporal high-pass filtering is provided with
      the `BrainVoyager User Guide
      <https://www.brainvoyager.com/bvqx/doc/UsersGuide/Preprocessing/TemporalHighPassFiltering.html>`_.
    - `This comment
      <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1899#issuecomment-561687460>`__
      on an issue regarding CompCor regressors.

**CompCor confounds**.
:abbr:`CompCor (Component Based Noise Correction)` is a :abbr:`PCA (principal component analysis)`,
hence component-based, noise pattern recognition method.
In the method, principal components are calculated within an :abbr:`ROI (Region of Interest)`
that is unlikely to include signal related to neuronal activity, such as :abbr:`CSF (cerebro-spinal fluid)`
and :abbr:`WM (white matter)` masks.
Signals extracted from CompCor components can be further regressed out from the fMRI data with a
denoising procedure [Behzadi2007]_.

- ``a_comp_cor_XX`` - additional noise components are calculated using anatomical :abbr:`CompCor
  (Component Based Noise Correction)`;
- ``t_comp_cor_XX`` - additional noise components are calculated using temporal :abbr:`CompCor
  (Component Based Noise Correction)`.

Four separate CompCor decompositions are performed to compute noise components: one temporal
decomposition (``t_comp_cor_XX``) and three anatomical decompositions (``a_comp_cor_XX``) across
three different noise ROIs: an eroded white matter mask, an eroded CSF mask, and a combined mask derived
from the union of these.

Each confounds data file will also have a corresponding metadata file
(``~desc-confounds_regressors.json``).
Metadata files contain additional information about columns in the confounds TSV file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "a_comp_cor_00": {
        "CumulativeVarianceExplained": 0.1081970825,
        "Mask": "combined",
        "Method": "aCompCor",
        "Retained": true,
        "SingularValue": 25.8270209974,
        "VarianceExplained": 0.1081970825
      },
      "dropped_0": {
        "CumulativeVarianceExplained": 0.5965809597,
        "Mask": "combined",
        "Method": "aCompCor",
        "Retained": false,
        "SingularValue": 20.7955177198,
        "VarianceExplained": 0.0701465624
      }
    }

For CompCor decompositions, entries include:

  - ``Method``: anatomical or temporal CompCor.
  - ``Mask``: denotes the :abbr:`ROI (region of interest)` where the decomposition that generated
    the component was performed: ``CSF``, ``WM``, or ``combined`` for anatomical CompCor.
  - ``SingularValue``: singular value of the component.
  - ``VarianceExplained``: the fraction of variance explained by the component across the decomposition ROI mask.
  - ``CumulativeVarianceExplained``: the total fraction of variance explained by this particular component
    and all preceding components.
  - ``Retained``: Indicates whether the component was saved in ``desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv``
    for use in denoising.
    Entries that are not saved in the data file for denoising are still stored in metadata with the
    ``dropped`` prefix.

.. caution::
    Only a subset of these CompCor decompositions should be used for further denoising.
    The original Behzadi aCompCor implementation [Behzadi2007]_ can be applied using
    components from the combined masks, while the more recent Muschelli implementation
    [Muschelli2014]_ can be applied using
    the :abbr:`WM (white matter)` and :abbr:`CSF (cerebro-spinal fluid)` masks.
    To determine the provenance of each component, consult the metadata file (described above).

    There are many valid ways of selecting CompCor components for further denoising.
    In general, the components with the largest singular values (i.e., those that
    explain the largest fraction of variance in the data) should be selected.
    *fMRIPrep* outputs components in descending order of singular value.
    Common approaches include selecting a fixed number of components (e.g., the
    first 5 or 6), using a quantitative or qualitative criterion (e.g., elbow, broken
    stick, or condition number), or using sufficiently many components that a minimum
    cumulative fraction of variance is explained (e.g., 50%).

.. caution::
    Similarly, if you are using anatomical or temporal CompCor it may not make sense
    to use the ``csf``, or ``white_matter`` global regressors -
    see `#1049 <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1049>`_.
    Conversely, using the overall ``global_signal`` confound in addition to CompCor's
    regressors can be beneficial (see [Parkes2018]_).

.. danger::
    *fMRIPrep* does high-pass filtering before running anatomical or temporal CompCor.
    Therefore, when using CompCor regressors, the corresponding ``cosine_XX`` regressors
    should also be included in the design matrix.

.. admonition:: See also

    This didactic `discussion on NeuroStars.org
    <https://neurostars.org/t/fmrirep-outputs-very-high-number-of-acompcors-up-to-1000/5451>`__
    where Patrick Sadil gets into details about PCA and how that base technique applies
    to CompCor in general and *fMRIPrep*'s implementation in particular.

**AROMA confounds**.
:abbr:`AROMA (Automatic Removal Of Motion Artifacts)` is an :abbr:`ICA (independent components analysis)`
based procedure to identify confounding time series related to head-motion [Prium2015]_.
ICA-AROMA can be enabled with the flag ``--use-aroma``.

- ``aroma_motion_XX`` - the motion-related components identified by ICA-AROMA.

.. danger::
    If you are already using AROMA-cleaned data (``~desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold.nii.gz``),
    do not include ICA-AROMA confounds during your design specification or denoising procedure.

    Additionally, as per [Hallquist2013]_ and [Lindquist2019]_, when using AROMA-cleaned data
    most of the confound regressors should be recalculated (this feature is a work-in-progress,
    follow up on `#1905 <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/issues/1905>`__).
    Surprisingly, `our simulations
    <https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep-notebooks/blob/9933a628dfb759dc73e61701c144d67898b92de0/05%20-%20Discussion%20AROMA%20confounds%20-%20issue-817%20%5BJ.%20Kent%5D.ipynb>`__
    (with thanks to JD. Kent) suggest that using the confounds as currently calculated by
    *fMRIPrep* --before denoising-- would be just fine.

.. caution::
    *Nonsteady-states* (or *dummy scans*) in the beginning of every run
    are dropped **before** ICA-AROMA is performed.
    Therefore, any subsequent analysis of ICA-AROMA outputs must drop the same
    number of *nonsteady-states*.

Confounds and "carpet"-plot on the visual reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The visual reports provide several sections per task and run to aid designing
a denoising strategy for subsequent analysis.
Some of the estimated confounds are plotted with a "carpet" visualization of the
:abbr:`BOLD (blood-oxygen level-dependent)` time series [Power2016]_.
An example of these plots follows:

.. figure:: _static/sub-01_task-mixedgamblestask_run-01_bold_carpetplot.svg

    The figure shows on top several confounds estimated for the BOLD series:
    global signals ('GlobalSignal', 'WM', 'GM'), standardized DVARS ('stdDVARS'),
    and framewise-displacement ('FramewiseDisplacement').
    At the bottom, a 'carpetplot' summarizing the BOLD series.
    The color-map on the left-side of the carpetplot denotes signals located
    in cortical gray matter regions (blue), subcortical gray matter (orange),
    cerebellum (green) and the union of white-matter and CSF compartments (red).

Noise components computed during each CompCor decomposition are evaluated according
to the fraction of variance that they explain across the nuisance ROI.
This is used by *fMRIPrep* to determine whether each component should be saved for
use in denoising operations: a component is saved if it contributes to explaining
the top 50 percent of variance in the nuisance ROI.
*fMRIPrep* can be configured to save all components instead using the command line
option ``--return-all-components``.
*fMRIPrep* reports include a plot of the cumulative variance explained by each
component, ordered by descending singular value.

.. figure:: _static/sub-01_task-rest_compcor.svg

    The figure displays the cumulative variance explained by components for each
    of four CompCor decompositions (left to right: anatomical CSF mask, anatomical
    white matter mask, anatomical combined mask, temporal).
    The number of components is plotted on the abscissa and
    the cumulative variance explained on the ordinate.
    Dotted lines indicate the minimum number of components necessary
    to explain 50%, 70%, and 90% of the variance in the nuisance mask.
    By default, only the components that explain the top 50% of the variance
    are saved.

Also included is a plot of correlations among confound regressors.
This can be used to guide selection of a confound model or to assess the extent
to which tissue-specific regressors correlate with global signal.

.. figure:: _static/sub-01_task-mixedgamblestask_run-01_confounds_correlation.svg

    The left-hand panel shows the matrix of correlations among selected confound
    time series as a heat-map.
    Note the zero-correlation blocks near the diagonal; these correspond to each
    CompCor decomposition.
    The right-hand panel displays the correlation of selected confound time series
    with the mean global signal computed across the whole brain; the regressors shown
    are those with greatest correlation with the global signal.
    This information can be used to diagnose partial volume effects.
