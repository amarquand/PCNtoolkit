Contributing
============

First off, thanks for considering contributing to PCNtoolkit! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to PCNtoolkit. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Setting up your local development environment
---------------------------------------------

You are always welcome to contribute code yourself. PCNtoolkit runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows with WSL. To contribute to PCNtoolkit you can follow the steps below to set your local development environment:

.. note::
    To use PCNtoolkit you need to have installed `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ and a Python version (we officially support Python version 3.11 and 3.12). Also, we recommend using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ to manage Python.

1. **Fork the repository** - Forking creates your own copy (your "fork") of PCNtoolkit on your GitHub. This gives you full write access to your fork so you can make changes and then submit Pull Requests to the original PCNtoolkit repository (that you don't have direct write access to). See `GitHub’s guide to forking <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_.

2. **Clone your fork** - Cloning is the process of downloading your GitHub copy of the project onto your computer, so you can make changes to the code locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/PCNtoolkit.git

3. **Create environment** - A Python environment is an isolated workspace that contains its own Python installation and libraries. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system. Here, we create an environment called ``ptk-dev`` and then activate it.

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -n ptk-dev python=3.12
       conda activate ptk-dev

4. **Install the dependencies** 

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e ".[dev]"

   The idea behind ``pip install -e`` is to make it easy to work on the code while you are developing it. Instead of treating the project as a finished product, Python treats it as “live” code, so you can edit it and test your changes right away. Also, ``".[dev]"`` lets you install extra dependencies that are useful when developing the project (for example for testing, or documentation).

.. note::
    **Alternative quicker option:** To simplify and automate commands that are frequently used during development, we use `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_. Common development tasks are defined as short scripts in the ``Makefile``. For example, steps 3 and 4 can be done with a single command: ``make dev-setup``. After it, you should activate the environment with ``conda activate ptk-dev``.

Congrats! You have now set up your development environment. 

To contribute, create a new branch based on the ``dev`` branch and open your pull request. Your pull request should be approved by at least one developer before merging. The ``dev`` branch is where we add changes for the next release and once we are ready to release to the public we move all our code to the ``master`` branch. Read more about `our branching and PR workflow <https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/PCNtoolkit/wiki/GitHub-workflow>`_ in our GitHub Wiki.

.. note::
    Ran into issues when you set up your dev environment? Check out `this list of common errors and how to fix them <https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/PCNtoolkit/wiki/Common-errors-in-dev-environment-setup>`_.

Running Tests
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest test/

Building the Website
--------------------

Our website lives in the ``doc/`` folder and is built with Sphinx. When you make changes to existing documentation or add new documentation (for more info, see `how to add a tutorial to the website <https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/PCNtoolkit/wiki/Add-a-tutorial-to-the-website>`_ page in our GitHub Wiki), you should build the website locally to check how everything looks. To do that:

1. Go to the ``doc/`` folder:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd doc

2. Install the documentation dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Build the website and keep it up to date: every time you save a change, the page reloads in your browser.

   .. code-block:: bash

       make livehtml

Code style
-----------

Git Commit Messages
"""""""""""""""""""

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Python code style
"""""""""""""""""""

All Python code must adhere to `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. We use `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ for linting and formatting which is installed in your development environment with ``pip install -e ".[dev]"``.
