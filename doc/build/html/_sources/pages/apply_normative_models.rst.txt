This notebook shows how to apply the coefficients from pre-estimated
normative models to new data. This can be done in two different ways:
(i) using a new set of data derived from the same sites used to estimate
the model and (ii) on a completely different set of sites. In the latter
case, we also need to estimate the site effect, which requires some
calibration/adaptation data. As an illustrative example, we use a
dataset derived from several `OpenNeuro
datasets <https://openneuro.org/>`__ and adapt the learned model to make
predictions on these data.

First, if necessary, we install PCNtoolkit (note: this tutorial requires
at least version 0.20)

.. code:: ipython3

    !pip install pcntoolkit==0.20

.. code:: ipython3

    ! git clone https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/braincharts.git

.. code:: ipython3

    # we need to be in the scripts folder when we import the libraries in the code block below,
    # because there is a function called nm_utils that is in the scripts folder that we need to import
    import os
    os.chdir('/content/braincharts/scripts/') #this path is setup for running on Google Colab. Change it to match your local path if running locally

Now we import the required libraries

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import pickle
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    
    from pcntoolkit.normative import estimate, predict, evaluate
    from pcntoolkit.util.utils import compute_MSLL, create_design_matrix
    from nm_utils import remove_bad_subjects, load_2d

We need to unzip the models.

.. code:: ipython3

    os.chdir('/content/braincharts/models/')

.. code:: ipython3

    ls


.. parsed-literal::

    lifespan_12K_57sites_mqc2_train.zip  lifespan_29K_82sites_train.zip
    lifespan_12K_59sites_mqc_train.zip   lifespan_57K_82sites.zip
    lifespan_23K_57sites_mqc2.zip        README.md


.. code:: ipython3

    # we will use the biggest sample as our training set (approx. N=57000 subjects from 82 sites)
    # for more info on the other pretrained models available in this repository, 
    # please refer to the accompanying paper https://elifesciences.org/articles/72904
    ! unzip lifespan_57K_82sites.zip

Next, we configure some basic variables, like where we want the analysis
to be done and which model we want to use.

.. note::
    We maintain a list of site ids for each dataset, which
    describe the site names in the training and test data (``site_ids_tr``
    and ``site_ids_te``), plus also the adaptation data . The training site
    ids are provided as a text file in the distribution and the test ids are
    extracted automatically from the pandas dataframe (see below). If you
    use additional data from the sites (e.g.Â later waves from ABCD), it may
    be necessary to adjust the site names to match the names in the training
    set. See the accompanying paper for more details

.. code:: ipython3

    # which model do we wish to use?
    model_name = 'lifespan_57K_82sites'
    site_names = 'site_ids_82sites.txt'
    
    # where the analysis takes place
    root_dir = '/content/braincharts'
    out_dir = os.path.join(root_dir, 'models', model_name)
    
    # load a set of site ids from this model. This must match the training data
    with open(os.path.join(root_dir,'docs', site_names)) as f:
        site_ids_tr = f.read().splitlines()

Download test dataset
-----------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, to demonstrate this tool we will use a test dataset
derived from the FCON 1000 dataset. We provide a prepackaged
training/test split of these data in the required format (also after
removing sites with only a few data points),
`here <https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/PCNtoolkit-demo/tree/main/data>`__.
you can get these data by running the following commmands:

.. code:: ipython3

    os.chdir(root_dir)
    !wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/braincharts/master/docs/OpenNeuroTransfer_te.csv
    !wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/braincharts/master/docs/OpenNeuroTransfer_tr.csv

Load test data
-----------------------------------------------------

Now we load the test data and remove some subjects that may have poor
scan quality. This asssesment is based on the Freesurfer Euler
characteristic as described in the papers below.

.. note::
    For the purposes of this tutorial, we make predictions for all
    sites in the FCON 1000 dataset, but two of them were also included in
    the training data (named â€˜Baltimoreâ€™ and â€˜NewYork_aâ€™). In this case,
    this will only slightly bias the accuracy, but in order to replicate the
    results in the paper, it would be necessary to additionally remove these
    sites from the test dataframe.

.. code:: ipython3

    test_data = os.path.join(root_dir, 'OpenNeuroTransfer_te.csv')
    
    df_te = pd.read_csv(test_data)
    
    # remove some bad subjects, this requires having a column called "avg_en" that corresponds to the average Euler number extracted from Freesurfer
    # df_te, bad_sub = remove_bad_subjects(df_te, df_te)
    
    # extract a list of unique site ids from the test set
    site_ids_te =  sorted(set(df_te['site'].to_list()))

(Optional) Load adaptation data
-----------------------------------------------------

If the data you wish to make predictions for is not derived from the
same scanning sites as those in the trainig set, it is necessary to
learn the site effect so that we can account for it in the predictions.
In order to do this in an unbiased way, we use a separate dataset, which
we refer to as â€˜adaptationâ€™ data. This must contain data for all the
same sites as in the test dataset and we assume these are coded in the
same way, based on a the â€˜sitenumâ€™ column in the dataframe.

.. code:: ipython3

    adaptation_data = os.path.join(root_dir, 'OpenNeuroTransfer_tr.csv')
    
    df_ad = pd.read_csv(adaptation_data)
    
    # remove some bad subjects, this requires having a column called "avg_en" that corresponds to the average Euler number extracted from Freesurfer
    # df_ad, bad_sub = remove_bad_subjects(df_ad, df_ad)
    
    # extract a list of unique site ids from the test set
    site_ids_ad =  sorted(set(df_ad['site'].to_list()))
    
    if not all(elem in site_ids_ad for elem in site_ids_te):
        print('Warning: some of the testing sites are not in the adaptation data')

Configure which models to fit
-----------------------------------------------------

Now, we configure which imaging derived phenotypes (IDPs) we would like
to process. This is just a list of column names in the dataframe we have
loaded above.

We could load the whole set (i.e.Â all phenotypes for which we have
models for â€¦

.. code:: ipython3

    # load the list of idps for left and right hemispheres, plus subcortical regions
    with open(os.path.join(root_dir,'docs','phenotypes_lh.txt')) as f:
        idp_ids_lh = f.read().splitlines()
    with open(os.path.join(root_dir,'docs','phenotypes_rh.txt')) as f:
        idp_ids_rh = f.read().splitlines()
    with open(os.path.join(root_dir,'docs','phenotypes_sc.txt')) as f:
        idp_ids_sc = f.read().splitlines()
    
    # we choose here to process all idps
    idp_ids = idp_ids_lh + idp_ids_rh + idp_ids_sc

â€¦ or alternatively, we could just specify a list

.. code:: ipython3

    idp_ids = [ 'Left-Thalamus-Proper', 'Left-Lateral-Ventricle', 'rh_MeanThickness_thickness']

Configure covariates
-----------------------------------------------------

Now, we configure some parameters to fit the model. First, we choose
which columns of the pandas dataframe contain the covariates (age and
sex). The site parameters are configured automatically later on by the
``configure_design_matrix()`` function, when we loop through the IDPs in
the list

The supplied coefficients are derived from a â€˜warpedâ€™ Bayesian linear
regression model, which uses a nonlinear warping function to model
non-Gaussianity (``sinarcsinh``) plus a non-linear basis expansion (a
cubic b-spline basis set with 5 knot points, which is the default value
in the PCNtoolkit package). Since we are sticking with the default
value, we do not need to specify any parameters for this, but we do need
to specify the limits. We choose to pad the input by a few years either
side of the input range. We will also set a couple of options that
control the estimation of the model

For further details about the likelihood warping approach, see the
accompanying paper and `Fraza et al
2021 <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.438429v1>`__.

.. code:: ipython3

    # which data columns do we wish to use as covariates? 
    cols_cov = ['age','sex']
    
    # limits for cubic B-spline basis 
    xmin = -5 
    xmax = 110
    
    # Absolute Z treshold above which a sample is considered to be an outlier (without fitting any model)
    outlier_thresh = 7

Make predictions
-----------------------------------------------------

This will make predictions for each IDP separately. This is done by
extracting a column from the dataframe (i.e.Â specifying the IDP as the
response variable) and saving it as a numpy array. Then, we configure
the covariates, which is a numpy data array having the number of rows
equal to the number of datapoints in the test set. The columns are
specified as follows:

-  A global intercept (column of ones)
-  The covariate columns (here age and sex, coded as 0=female/1=male)
-  Dummy coded columns for the sites in the training set (one column per
   site)
-  Columns for the basis expansion (seven columns for the default
   parameterisation)

Once these are saved as numpy arrays in ascii format (as here) or
(alternatively) in pickle format, these are passed as inputs to the
``predict()`` method in the PCNtoolkit normative modelling framework.
These are written in the same format to the location specified by
``idp_dir``. At the end of this step, we have a set of predictions and
Z-statistics for the test dataset that we can take forward to further
analysis.

When we need to make predictions on new data, the procedure is
more involved, since we need to prepare, process and store covariates,
response variables and site ids for the adaptation data.

.. code:: ipython3

    for idp_num, idp in enumerate(idp_ids): 
        print('Running IDP', idp_num, idp, ':')

        # check whether all sites in the test set are represented in the training set

Preparing dummy data for plotting
-----------------------------------------------------

Now, we plot the centiles of variation estimated by the normative model.

We do this by making use of a set of dummy covariates that span the
whole range of the input space (for age) for a fixed value of the other
covariates (e.g.Â sex) so that we can make predictions for these dummy
data points, then plot them. We configure these dummy predictions using
the same procedure as we used for the real data. We can use the same
dummy data for all the IDPs we wish to plot

.. code:: ipython3

    # which sex do we want to plot? 
    sex = 1 # 1 = male 0 = female
    if sex == 1: 
        clr = 'blue';
    else:
        clr = 'red'
    
    # create dummy data for visualisation
    print('configuring dummy data ...')
    xx = np.arange(xmin, xmax, 0.5)
    X0_dummy = np.zeros((len(xx), 2))
    X0_dummy[:,0] = xx
    X0_dummy[:,1] = sex
    
    # create the design matrix
    X_dummy = create_design_matrix(X0_dummy, xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, site_ids=None, all_sites=site_ids_tr)
    
    # save the dummy covariates
    cov_file_dummy = os.path.join(out_dir,'cov_bspline_dummy_mean.txt')
    np.savetxt(cov_file_dummy, X_dummy)


.. parsed-literal::

    configuring dummy data ...


Plotting the normative models
-----------------------------------------------------

Now we loop through the IDPs, plotting each one separately. The outputs
of this step are a set of quantitative regression metrics for each IDP
and a set of centile curves which we plot the test data against.

This part of the code is relatively complex because we need to keep
track of many quantities for the plotting. We also need to remember
whether the data need to be warped or not. By default in PCNtoolkit,
predictions in the form of ``yhat, s2`` are always in the warped
(Gaussian) space. If we want predictions in the input (non-Gaussian)
space, then we need to warp them with the inverse of the estimated
warping function. This can be done using the function
``nm.blr.warp.warp_predictions()``.

.. note::
    It is necessary to update the intercept for each of the sites.
    For purposes of visualisation, here we do this by adjusting the median
    of the data to match the dummy predictions, but note that all the
    quantitative metrics are estimated using the predictions that are
    adjusted properly using a learned offset (or adjusted using a hold-out
    adaptation set, as above). Note also that for the calibration data we
    require at least two data points of the same sex in each site to be able
    to estimate the variance. Of course, in a real example, you would want
    many more than just two since we need to get a reliable estimate of the
    variance for each site.

.. code:: ipython3

    sns.set(style='whitegrid')
    
    for idp_num, idp in enumerate(idp_ids): 
        print('Running IDP', idp_num, idp, ':')

want to summarize the deviation scores across all models estimates so we
can organize them into a single file, and merge the deviation scores
into the original data file.
