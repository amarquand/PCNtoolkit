        must be greater than zero; missing or zero entries usually indicate
        uncomputed offsets and those segments are omitted with a warning.
    timepoint_diff : int, default 1
        Covariate step between the two timepoints on each segment (e.g. 1 year).
    z_thrive : float, default -1.96
        Shrinkage term passed through to ``propagate``.
    propagate : callable, default :func:`propagate_thriveline_z`
        Function that propagates z-scores along one segment:
        ``propagate(hop_correlations, start_z, z_thrive) -> xr.DataArray``.
        The default implements the update of Bayer et al. (2026); alternative
        propagators may be supplied to extend the toolbox.
    anchor_step : int, default 1
        Spacing between starting covariate anchors on the overlay grid.
    z_anchor_start, z_anchor_end : int, default -3 and 4
        Half-open range ``[z_anchor_start, z_anchor_end)`` of integer starting
        z-scores used when ``z_anchors`` is not provided.
    z_anchors : array-like of float, optional

    covariate_range : tuple of int, optional

        anchors. When omitted, anchors span the covariate coordinates in ``R``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : NormativeModel
        Fitted normative model providing scalers and regional ``backward``
        maps.
    thrive_Z : xr.DataArray or xr.Dataset
        Propagated z-scores from :func:`compute_thrivelines`, with dimensions
        ``(segment, response_vars, offset)``. When an ``xr.Dataset`` is
        passed (e.g. from :meth:`~pcntoolkit.longitudinal_score.zgain_score.ZGainScore.get_thrivelines`),
        it must contain data variables ``Z`` and ``X``; ``thrive_X`` may then
        be omitted.
    thrive_X : xr.DataArray, optional
        Matching covariate coordinates, same shape as ``thrive_Z``. Required
        when ``thrive_Z`` is not a Dataset with ``Z`` and ``X``.
    covariate : str, optional
        Covariate along which thrivelines advance (e.g. ``"age"``). Required
        when the model has more than one covariate; otherwise the sole model
        covariate is used.
    batch_effects : dict of str, optional
        Reference batch labels keyed by batch-effect dimension
        (e.g. ``{"site": "A"}``). When omitted or incomplete, missing keys
        are filled from the first allowed level in
        ``model.unique_batch_effects`` (same rule as
        :func:`~pcntoolkit.util.plotter.plot_thrivelines`). Ignored when
        the model has no batch effects.
