# Contributing to *PCNtoolkit*

Welcome to the *PCNtoolkit* repository!
We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

**Imposter's syndrome disclaimer**[^1]: We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that
you're not ready to be an open-source contributor; that your skills
aren't nearly good enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a
project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can
write code at all, you can contribute code to open-source. Contributing
to open-source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding
skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good developer (that
would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something, making
mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve,
and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open-source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either.
You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving
feedback about the project (and yes - that includes giving feedback
about the contribution process). Some of these contributions may be the
most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the
project with fresh eyes, so you can see the errors and assumptions that
seasoned contributors have glossed over.

## Driving principles

*PCNtoolkit* is built around three overarching principles:

1. **Robustness** - The pipeline adapts the preprocessing steps depending on
   the input dataset and should provide results as good as possible
   independently of scanner make, scanning parameters or presence of additional
   correction scans (such as fieldmaps).
1. **Ease of use** - Thanks to dependence on the BIDS standard, manual
   parameter input is reduced to a minimum, allowing the pipeline to run in an
   automatic fashion.
1. **"Glass box"** philosophy - Automation should not mean that one should not
   visually inspect the results or understand the methods.
   Thus, *fMRIPrep* provides visual reports for each subject, detailing the
   accuracy of the most important processing steps.
   This, combined with the documentation, can help researchers to understand
   the process and decide which subjects should be kept for the group level
   analysis.

These principles distill some design and organizational foundations:

  1. The tool only and fully supports BIDS and BIDS-Derivatives for the input and output data.
  1. The tool is packaged as a fully-compliant [BIDS-App][link_bidsapps], not just in its user
     interface, but also in the continuous integration, testing and delivery.
  1. The tool is rigorously restricted to functional MRI preprocessing, including (but not limited to):
     input/output metadata assessment, head-motion correction, susceptibility-distortion correction,
     co-registration with anatomical data, spatial normalization to neuroimaging templates, 
     noise components and other confounds extraction, etc.
     In other words, the tool does not deal with time filtering*, smoothing*, modeling,
     or connectivity extraction.
  1. The tool is **agnostic to subsequent analysis**, i.e., any software supporting BIDS-Derivatives
     for its inputs should be amenable to fit GLMs, extract time-series for connectivity analyses, etc.
  1. The tool is thoroughly and transparently documented (including the generation of individual reports
     that can be used as scaffolds for understanding the underpinnings and design decisions of the tool).
  1. The tool is community-driven, with a very open concept of contribution that is always credited
     with authorship offers when writing relevant papers.


## Practical guide to submitting your contribution

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below,
please let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues]!

Before you start, you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Already know what you're looking for in this guide? Jump to the following sections:

* [Joining the conversation](#joining-the-conversation)
* [Contributing through Github](#contributing-through-github)
* [Understanding issues](#understanding-issues)
* [Making a change](#making-a-change)
* [Structuring contributions](#fMRIPrep-coding-style-guide)
* [Licensing](#licensing)
* [Recognizing contributors](#recognizing-contributions)

## Joining the conversation

*PCNtoolkit* is maintained by a growing group of enthusiastic developers&mdash;
and we're excited to have you join!
Most of our discussions will take place on open [issues][link_issues].

We also encourage users to report any difficulties they encounter on [NeuroStars][link_neurostars],
a community platform for discussing neuroimaging.

We actively monitor both spaces and look forward to hearing from you in either venue!

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][link_git] is a really useful tool for version control.
[GitHub][link_github] sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

If you're not yet familiar with `git`, there are lots of great resources to help you *git* started!
Some of our favorites include the [git Handbook][link_handbook] and
the [Software Carpentry introduction to git][link_swc_intro].

On GitHub, You'll use [Markdown][markdown] to chat in issues and pull requests.
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub
to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`),
or as a [link][rick_roll] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

GitHub has a really helpful page for getting started with
[writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub][writing_formatting_github].

## Understanding issues

Every project on GitHub uses [issues][link_issues] slightly differently.

The following outlines how the *PCNtoolkit* developers think about these tools.

* **Issues** are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forward.
A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that
is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

    Issues are assigned [labels](#issue-labels) which explain how they relate to the overall project's
    goals and immediate next steps.

### Issue Labels

The current list of issue labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Good first issue](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/good%20first%20issue)][link_firstissue] *These issues contain a task that is amenable to new contributors because it doesn't entail a steep learning curve.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues,
    we especially encourage you to do so!

* [![Bug](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/bug)][link_bugs] *These issues point to problems in the project.*

    If you find new a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue,
    including steps to recreate the error.
    If you experience the same bug as one already listed,
    please add any additional information that you have as a comment.

* [![Feature](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/feature)][link_enhancement] *These issues are asking for new features and improvements to be considered by the project.*

    Please try to make sure that your requested feature is distinct from any others
    that have already been requested or implemented.
    If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences,
    please reference the other request in your issue.

In order to define priorities and directions in the development roadmap,
we have two sets of special labels:

| Label                                                                                           | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20high) <br> ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20medium) <br> ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20low)    | Estimation of the downstream impact the proposed feature/bugfix will have.                |
| ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20high) <br> ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20medium) <br> ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20low)    | Estimation of effort required to implement the requested feature or fix the reported bug. |

One way to understand these labels is to consider how they would apply to an imaginary issue.
For example, if -- after a release -- a bug is identified that re-introduces a previously solved issue
(i.e., its regresses the code outputs to some undesired behavior), we might assign it the following labels:
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/bug)
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20high)
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20low).
Its development priority would then be "high", since it is a low-effort, high-impact change.

Long-term goals may be labelled as a combination of:
![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20high) and  ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20medium) or ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20high)
since they will have a high-impact on the code-base, but require a medium or high amount of effort.
Of note, issues with the labels:
 ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/impact%3A%20low) or ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/nipreps/fmriprep/effort%3A%20high)
are less likely to be addressed because they are less likely to impact the code-base, or because they will require a very high activation energy to do so.

## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to *fMRIPrep*,
but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

1. **Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**<br />
  This allows other members of the *fMRIPrep* development team to confirm that you aren't
  overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page
  with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.<br />
  [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front
  is so useful to everyone involved.
  
1. **[Fork][link_fork] the [PCNtoolkit repository][link_fMRIPrep] to your profile.**<br />
  This is now your own unique copy of *PCNtoolkit*.
  Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!
  
1. **[Clone][link_clone] your forked PCNtoolkit repository to your machine/computer.**<br />
  While you can edit files [directly on github][link_githubedit], sometimes the changes
  you want to make will be complex and you will want to use a [text editor][link_texteditor]
  that you have installed on your local machine/computer.
  (One great text editor is [vscode][link_vscode]).<br />  
  In order to work on the code locally, you must clone your forked repository.<br />  
  To keep up with changes in the fMRIPrep repository,
  add the ["upstream" PCNtoolkit repository as a remote][link_addremote]
  to your locally cloned repository.  
    ```Shell
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep.git
    ```
    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the upstream repository.<br />  
    For example, to update your master branch on your local cloned repository:  
      ```Shell
      git fetch upstream
      git checkout master
      git merge upstream/master
      ```

1. **Create a [new branch][link_branches] to develop and maintain the proposed code changes.**<br />
  For example:
    ```Shell
    git fetch upstream  # Always start with an updated upstream
    git checkout -b fix/bug-1222 upstream/master
    ```
    Please consider using appropriate branch names as those listed below, and mind that some of them
    are special (e.g., `doc/` and `docs/`):
      * `fix/<some-identifier>`: for bugfixes
      * `enh/<feature-name>`: for new features
      * `doc/<some-identifier>`: for documentation improvements.
        You should name all your documentation branches with the prefix `doc/` or `docs/`
        as that will preempt triggering the full battery of continuous integration tests.

1. **Make the changes you've discussed, following the [PCNtoolkit coding style guide](#fMRIPrep-coding-style-guide).**<br />
  Try to keep the changes focused: it is generally easy to review changes that address one feature or bug at a time.
  It can also be helpful to test your changes locally,
  using a [PCNtoolkit development environment][link_devel].
  Once you are satisfied with your local changes, [add/commit/push them][link_add_commit_push]
  to the branch on your forked repository.

1. **Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].**<br />
   A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm
   that they can be merged into the main code base.<br />
   Pull request titles should begin with a descriptive prefix
   (for example, `ENH: Support for SB-reference in multi-band datasets`):  
     * `ENH`: enhancements or new features ([example][enh_ex])
     * `FIX`: bug fixes ([example][fix_ex])
     * `TST`: new or updated tests ([example][tst_ex])
     * `DOC`: new or updated documentation ([example][doc_ex])
     * `STY`: style changes ([example][sty_ex])
     * `REF`: refactoring existing code ([example][ref_ex])
     * `CI`: updates to continous integration infrastructure ([example][ci_ex])
     * `MAINT`: general maintenance ([example][maint_ex])
     * For works-in-progress, add the `WIP` tag in addition to the descriptive prefix.
       Pull-requests tagged with `WIP:` will not be merged until the tag is removed.

1. **Have your PR reviewed by the developers team, and update your changes accordingly in your branch.**<br />
   The reviewers will take special care in assisting you address their comments, as well as dealing with conflicts
   and other tricky situations that could emerge from distributed development.

## PCNtoolkit coding style guide

Whenever possible, instances of Nipype `Node`s and `Workflow`s should use the same names
as the variables they are assigned to.
This makes it easier to relate the content of the working directory to the code
that generated it when debugging.

Workflow variables should end in `_wf` to indicate that they refer to Workflows
and not Nodes.
For instance, a workflow whose basename is `myworkflow` might be defined as
follows:

```Python
from nipype.pipeline import engine as pe

myworkflow_wf = pe.Workflow(name='myworkflow_wf')
```

If a workflow is generated by a function, the name of the function should take
the form `init_<basename>_wf`:

```Python
def init_myworkflow_wf(name='myworkflow_wf):
    workflow = pe.Workflow(name=name)
    ...
    return workflow

myworkflow_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_wf')
```

If multiple instances of the same workflow might be instantiated in the same
namespace, the workflow names and variables should include either a numeric
identifier or a one-word description, such as:

```Python
myworkflow0_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow0_wf')
myworkflow1_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow1_wf')

# or

myworkflow_lh_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_lh_wf')
myworkflow_rh_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_rh_wf')
```

## Recognizing contributions

We welcome and recognize all contributions regardless their size, content or scope:
from documentation to testing and code development.
You can see a list of current developers and contributors in our [zenodo file][link_zenodo].
Before every release, a new [zenodo file][link_zenodo] will be generated.
The [update script][link_update_script] will also sort creators and contributors by
the relative size of their contributions, as provided by the `git-line-summary` utility
distributed with the `git-extras` package.
Last positions in both the *creators* and *contributors* list will be reserved to
the project leaders.
These special positions can be revised to add names by punctual request and revised for
removal and update of ordering in an scheduled manner every two years.
All the authors enlisted as *creators* participate in the revision of modifications.

### Developers

Developers are members of a wonderful team _driving the project_.
Names and contacts of all developers are included in the
[``.maint/developers.json`` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/developers.json)
Examples of steering activities that _drive the project_ are: actively participating in the
follow-up meetings, leading documentation sprints, helping in the design of the tool and definition of the roadmap,
providing resources (in the broad sense, including funding), code-review, etc.

### Contributors

Contributors enlisted in the
[``.maint/contributors.json`` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/contributors.json)
actively help or have previously helped the project in a broad sense: writing code, writing documentation,
benchmarking modules of the tool, proposing new features, helping improve the scientific
rigor of implementations, giving out support on the different communication
channels ([mattermost][link_mattermost], [NeuroStars][link_neurostars], [GitHub issues][link_issues], etc.).
If you are new to the project, don't forget to add your name and affiliation to the list
of contributors there!
Our Welcome Bot will send an automated message reminding this to first-time contributors.
Before every release, unlisted contributors will be invited again to add their names to the file
(just in case they missed the automated message from our Welcome Bot).

Contributors who have contributed at some point to the project but were required or they wished to
disconnect from the project's updates and to drop-out from publications and other dissemination activities,
are listed in the [``.maint/former.json`` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/former.json).

### Publications

Anyone listed as a *developer* or a *contributor* can start the submission process of a manuscript
as first author.
To compose the author list, all the *creators* MUST be included (except for those people who
opt to drop-out) and all the *contributors* MUST be invited to participate.
First authorship(s) is (are) reserved for the authors that originated and kept the initiative
of submission and wrote the manuscript.
To generate the ordering of your paper, please run ``python .maint/paper_author_list.py`` from the
root of the repository, on the up-to-date ``upstream/master`` branch.
Then, please modify this list and place your name first.
All developers and contributors are pulled together in a unique list, and last authorships assigned.
*fMRIPrep* and its community adheres to open science principles, such that a pre-print should
be posted on an adequate archive service (e.g., [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org) or
[BioRxiv](https://biorxiv.org)) prior publication.
