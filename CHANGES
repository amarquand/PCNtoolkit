version 0.15
A number of new functions have been implemented and we decided to use a new version numbering system to improve consistency.

version 0.16
Minor bug fix relative to release 0.15. Fixed a transpose operation that would cause normative.py to fail in certain cases

version 0.17:
Changes:
- New syntax for functions related to parallelization (python path is automatically generated)
- Support for slurm clusters has been added
- Updates to hierarchical Bayesian regression (different priors for intercepts and noise) for improved transfer
- Updated parameterisation for likelihood warping for improved stability
- Now uses a fixed pickle protocol for better interoperability
- Addition of a utility function for loading freesurfer measures
- Updated sphinx documentation

version 0.18
Changes:
- addition of cross-validation functionality for HBR
- minor bug fixes for HBR

version 0.19
Changes:
- separate standardization of responses and covariates
- standardization is no longer on by default
- new standardization methods
- pymc3 version fixed
- minor bugs resolved (CV with HBR)

version 0.20
Changes:
- Major code refactoring
- Requirements updated for python 3.8.3
- Updates to documentation and Integrations with Read the Docs
- Addition of tutorial material
- Performance improvements for BLR (not compatible with previous versions)
- Addition of heteroskedastic noise for BLR
- Addition of Bayesian Information Criterion for BLR
- Addition of utility functions (e.g. design matrix construction)
- Several minor bug fixes (mostly related to HBR and BLR)

version 0.21
Relatively minor updates with respect to version 0.20, including:
- documentation updates
- minor updates to warp (including bug fix for the compostition)
- software version is saved in models
- utility functions for calibration descriptives and extreme values

version 0.22
Some minor updates and bug fixes:
- updates to documentation and tutorials
- updates to normative_parallel (interactive usage)
- updates to HBR (merge functionality)
- other minor bug fixes related to cross-validation (computation of error metrics), import problems and calibration statistics

version 0.23
Changes:
- SHASH functionality for HBR added
- Bug fix for normative model predict() function
